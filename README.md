# PC-Server-Client-Component

This project is a small component for server-client communications,. I created the project long ago when I was intrested in data sending between different machines through internet and I needed a component to handle that part without needing to create it over and over again when I start new project. The project is not complete, but at the current state the software sends and receives messages as intended. What is left to do, is exception handling and automated reconnects.

This project uses boost -libraries for threads and connection creation. I chose to use/learn this for the better thread/memory handling tools and for the increased portability.

Currently only source code available. Adding demo later when work is finished.
