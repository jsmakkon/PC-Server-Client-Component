# Server_Client_Programming

This project is a small component for server-client communications. I created the project long ago when I was intrested in data sending between different machines through internet. At the current state the software sends and receives messages, but doesn't handle exceptions very well.

This project uses boost -libraries for threads and connection creation. I chose to use/learn this for the better thread/memory handling tools and for the increased portability.

Currently only sources available. Adding executable with proper demo later when work is finished.
